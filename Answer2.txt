The upstream remote is usually used as a "central" repository, where the 
master branch can be retrieved and many users can collaborate on 
different aspects of the project. Git is a DVCS though, so every repository 
is a full copy of the remote one and can be used to retrieve the master. 

After some research I am not 100% sure about the termonology, cause "Upstream" remote is sometimes 
used to define the remote repository used to track changes of a local branch as the one set with: 

 git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
 
 EDIT: After some more research, I have found another use for the term as in "set an Upstream repository in order to 
       Sync a fork with the original repository": 
       
       git add remote upstream Https://github.com/path/to/repository
                 and 
       git fetch upstream
