The upstream remote is usually used as a "central" repository, where the 
master branch can be retrieved and many users can collaborate on 
different aspects of the project. Git is a DVCS though, so every repository 
is a full copy of the remote one and can be used to retrieve the master. 

After some research I am not 100% sure about the termonology, cause "Upstream" remote is sometimes 
used to define the remote repository used to track changes of a local branch as the one set with: 

 git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
